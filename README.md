Library Application

Overview:
During my internship, I developed a comprehensive library application with a range of features to manage books efficiently. The application includes functionalities for listing books, searching books, adding new books, deleting books, and borrowing books. It also supports real-time notifications for new book additions using WebSockets.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js
Database: MySQL

Key Features:
List Books: Display all available books in the library.
Search Books: Find books based on various criteria.
Add New Books: Add new books to the library database.
Delete Books: Remove books from the library by name.
Borrow Books: Borrow books by name, with status updates.
Real-Time Notifications: Receive notifications for new book additions using WebSockets.
Recent Actions: Display recent actions in a dedicated section.
Borrowed Books View: Show borrowed books with a sidebar button.
Modern UI Design: Ensured a professional and organized look, avoiding excessive scrolling with a sidebar design.

Challenges:
Ensuring the update form disappeared after updates and correctly handling book statuses.
Implementing WebSockets integration for real-time notifications seamlessly.
Keeping the design modern and user-friendly, with a professional appearance.

Outcome:
The library application provides a user-friendly interface for managing library operations efficiently. The modern design and robust functionalities make it suitable for real-world usability, meeting the needs of both library staff and users.
